/*
  This file is for custom CSS for the DietChart component.
  The styling for this component is almost entirely handled by Tailwind CSS utility classes in the DietChart.jsx file.
  
  You can add custom styles here if you have complex requirements
  not easily achievable with Tailwind, such as custom keyframe animations.

/* Example: To use a specific font like 'Inter' from Google Fonts, you would add this: */
/*
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
